# Similarity Modeling Project
## Goal
Hand in jupyter-notebook that predicts appearences of kermit the frog an the 2 old men on the muppet show. 3 videos are given and should be in `media/` folder in this root directory


## ToDos for intermediate handin
- only focus on kermit for now, but create ground truths for both classes 
- create classifier for audio and video separately, and/or both combined
    - build ensemble on it
### G
- create ground truth for video 1
- feature extraction audio for kermit
### O
- create ground truth for video 2
- feature extraction video for kermit


## ToDos
- [x] define test/train split strategy
- [ ] create ground truth
- [ ] extract features 
- [ ] train simple classifier
- [ ] do intermediate handin ( **DUE ~~23.11.~~ 7.12. ** )
- [ ] train more sophisticated classifer
- [ ] param tuning ...
